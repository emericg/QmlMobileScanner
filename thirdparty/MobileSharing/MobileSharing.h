 * \brief Cross-platform file & text sharing, exposed to QML as the `MobileSharing` type.
 *
 * This is the public entry point of the module. It wraps a per-platform PlatformShareUtils
 * backend and offers a uniform API to:
 *  - send text/URLs (sendText()) and files (sendFile()) to other apps,
 *  - view a file in another app (viewFile()),
 *  - save a file to a user-chosen location (saveFile()) and open one (openFile() / importFile()),
 *  - receive files shared into the app (fileReceived()).
 *
 * Files the module hands out or takes in live in a session-scoped cache directory
 * (see getCacheDirectory()) that is wiped at every startup; copy anything you want to keep
 * into your own storage. Outgoing operations take a caller-chosen \c requestId that is echoed
 * back in the result signals (shareFinished(), shareError(), fileSaved(), ...).
